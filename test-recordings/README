This directory and subdirectories contains audio files for test
purposes.

All recordings are public domain or field recordings of no particular
interest made specifically for testing this project.

The audio quality is generally quite terrible, but that doesn't matter
too much for the tests. Many of the recordings have been truncated at
around the two minute mark. If you really want recordings of Scott
Joplin's piano rags look on the Internet Archive or somewhere. They
were recorded in the early 1900s and are truly out of copyright.

This README file itself forms part of the test, providing an example
of a non-audio file.
